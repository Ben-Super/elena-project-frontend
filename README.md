# EleNa Project Frontend

By the 'OHill Squad' (Ben Super, Phil Hopen, Jurgen Yu, Sanjay Rajasekaran, and Jigar Patel)

This is the frontend of our CS520 final project. It is a reactive webpage that allows the user to input coordinates and see a route that either maximizes or minimizes elevation plotted on an interactive 'click-and-drag' map.

## Run on a Dev Server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
NOTE: The routing will not work without a running instance of our backend: https://github.com/pjhopen/elena-project-backend

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
